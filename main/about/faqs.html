                        How long does the process take?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The processing time varies depending on the order.
                        Everyone's needs are different and we try to do our
                        best to accommodate them. On average, it takes about
                        2-4 weeks from start to finish.

                        Can I save on shipping costs if I pick up my object or
                        object's in person?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely! Just contact us before we ship your order
                        and let us know that you'll be picking it up in person.
                        You can pick up your object at our
                        UWSP production facility.

                        Do you allow bulk orders?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Due to our limited number of printers and the slow nature
                        of FDM 3D printing, we are unable to accommodate bulk orders
                        at this time, sorry!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>
                        Can I reduce the cost of my order if I provide you with
                        pre-made 3D models to print?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes. Our 3D modelling services demand an extra charge, so if you
                        already have a 3D model that you'd like printed, just include
                        it in your order request form.
                    </p>

                        Will different colors, sizes, and materials effect the
                        price of my order?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        We are happy to say that we can offer every color for the
                        same price, however, certain printing materials may
                        require a premium. We don't charge
                        extra for larger objects, but we do charge for total
                        material printed so larger objects may use more material.

                        What if I want my object printed with more than one
                        material or color?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        We are able to use our dual-nozzle printers to print
                        with two colors or two similar melting-point filaments
                        at the same time! This type of order is usually special and
                        entails an additional small fee.

                    <h4>
                        If I order multiple objects, can I have each object printed
                        in a different size, color, or material?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Yes, however, not in the same order. We've found that it's
                        much simpler for everyone if each object in the order is
                        identical. If you'd like to order multiple sizes, colors,
                        or materials, then please make separate orders. We will work
                        with you to ship everything together to save on delivery costs.

                        What if I'm not satisfied with your rendition of my 3D
                        model request?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Our 3D modellers do their best to work with you and bring
                        your ideas to fruition. We ask for as much details as you're
                        able to give us for creating your 3D model. Sometimes our
                        designers must fill in the gaps when details are lacking.
                        If you're not satisfied with the outcome of your 3D model, we
                        offer one free revision based on your feedback.

                    <p>
                        Nope! We also design and 3D print fully functional
                        items that you can use for repairs, replacements, or everyday
                        tasks. Many of our objects are both useful and stylish!
